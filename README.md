Steps to solving!

First I started with creating the board with HTML and CSS. Once I had the basic structure, I started to work on the game logic using jQuery and JS. After working for a couple hours, I found I hit a wall in my game logic and decided to work complete the game authentication (ajax and jQuery).

  I managed to get all the authentication working and started on the Game API (also ajax and jQuery). I was able to get
  Create and update working properly, then touched back on the game logic...which isn't excatly working.

  UnSolved problems.
  1. Disable the game until signup and newgame have been clicked.
  2. Find a better method to switch players and display the correct message at appropriate times.
  3. Fix checkForWin function
  4. Get GET games working and display played games and how many each player as won.
